# OOP2021-DictionaryProject

BN - This Readme file was created since I've just done the insertFromCommandline method (Improved Commandline Dictionary 1).

Versions:
- main: primitive commandline dictionary (???)
- betaN: updated insertFromCommandline()
- betaQ: implementing a tree data structure for the dictionary (maybe have better performence).
